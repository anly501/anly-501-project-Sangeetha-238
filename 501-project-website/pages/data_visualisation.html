        <h3 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 45px; margin-right: 45px; color: gray;"> Data Visualisation</h3>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">Data visualization "refers to the transformation of figures and raw data into visual objects such as points, bars, line plots, maps, and so on." These visualizations accelerate research and data analysis by combining user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing features.
        Data visualization is the use of popular graphics to depict data, such as charts, plots, infographics, and even animations. These information visualizations explain complicated data relationships and data-driven insights in an easy-to-understand manner.
        The purpose of data visualization can be divided into three categories: exploration, monitoring, and explanation. While some visualizations can span multiple of these, the majority focus on a single goal.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px; color: gray;"> To Explore</h4>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">
        A data visualization focused on exploration and rapid iteration can assist users who are looking for an open-ended tool to help them find patterns and insights in data. Exploration tools should be tightly linked to tools that collect (extract), clean (transform), and curate (load) data.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px; color: gray;"> To Monitor</h4>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">
        A data visualization focused on monitoring is best when users need to check on the performance of something. Dashboards, for example, should focus on leading indicators and display information that is linked to useful and direct actions.
    </p>
    <h4 style="text-align: left; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px; color: gray;"> To explain</h4>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">
        A data visualization focused on explanation is ideal when users want to go beyond the "what" of a problem and investigate the "why." Explanatory visualizations are often handcrafted to help a large audience understand a complex subject and are typically not automatable.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">Something as basic as presenting data graphically may appear to have no drawbacks. However, data might be distorted or misconstrued when displayed in the incorrect data visualization manner. When deciding whether to develop a data visualization, consider both the benefits and drawbacks.
    <br>
    <br>
    Advantages<br>
    Colors and patterns catch our attention. We can swiftly distinguish between red and blue, as well as squares and circles. Everything in our culture is visual, from art and marketing to TV and movies. Data visualization is another sort of visual art that captures our attention and holds it there. When we look at a chart, we can easily see trends and outliers. When we observe something, we rapidly internalize it. It's narrative with a purpose. If you've ever looked at a big spreadsheet of data and couldn't find a trend, you understand how much more useful a visualization can be.
  <br>
  <br>
  Disadvantages<br>
While there are many advantages, some of the disadvantages may seem less obvious. For example, when viewing a visualization with many different datapoints, it’s easy to make an inaccurate assumption. Or sometimes the visualization is just designed wrong so that it’s biased or confusing.
  </p>

    <h5 style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">
        The visualization was done on raw data that I collected from various sources.

              <center> Plotted wordcloud for the recent twitter data last 7 days. A word cloud is a basic yet useful visual representation object for text processing that displays the most frequently occurring words in larger and bolder letters, as well as in different colors. The smaller the size of the word, the less essential it is.
              Word clouds are created by removing stopwords, Wordcloud comes with an inbuilt library of stop words, that will automatically remove the stop words from the text.

                The twitter data is collected using tweepy library in python. The data for the latest week is collected to stay relevant to today's world and today's opinion climate change.

      <p style="font-size:14px; margin-left: 55px; margin-right: 55px;">From the data trends we can come to a conclusion that there has been significant change in temperature and humidity over years. These changes are more than estimated. Human activities imact climate change for example waste food disposal and even something as basic as agriculture practices have harmful effect on environment as they release harmful elements into the environment.</p>
