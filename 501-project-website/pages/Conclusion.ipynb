    "It is true that we take climate change and the environment for granted more than we should. The purpose was to analyze climate change trends and how humans are mostly responsible for these trends. Based on the data I gathered, I concluded that there has been a considerable change in temperature, which has been rapidly increasing.\n",

    "The Original data shows that highest variation in average temperature was recorded in India in past six years. China is right behind India and Canada has recorded third highest increse in temperature. \n",
    "#### Naive Bayes on Temperature data.\n",
    "The dataset was trained to predict temperature forecasts in several nations based on historical temperature data, and the model is 95% accurate in most cases, predicting higher temperatures than projected temperatures. This indicates that the temperature is rising and that we are on the verge of global warming.\n",
    "The data for the temperature record for the previous five years is collected, the expectation assumptions are formed, and the Bayes model is used to forecast the temperature difference. The accuracy of the models was 95% in each case. The precision for this data is fairly good, indicating that the model can accurately forecast temperature variance. More data  can be used to improve the model.\n"

    "The link between humans impacting the environment and the environment affecting humans is obvious, but for the time being, I'd like to focus on the human impact on climate change. The large temperature shift is caused by the release of hazardous components into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an illustration of how humans emit dangerous components into the atmosphere, I gathered data on emissions caused by waste food disposal and crop residue in the United States. I chose these two domains because agricultural cultivation and food disposal are fundamental human activities. If we can inflict environmental damage through everyday activities, the repercussions of a nuclear power plant are unthinkable."

The prediction aids in avoiding hazardous emissions such as CO2 caused by any crop or food disposal process, and may be able to identify an alternative for that process."

To get the outcome, three distinct clustering techniques were used, K-means, density-based spatial clustering with noise, and hierarchical clustering. The model demonstrates that the toxicities aren’t very diverse to one other in an attempt to discover similarities within the air toxicity."
