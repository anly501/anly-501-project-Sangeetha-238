<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>It is true that we take climate change and the environment for granted more than we should. The purpose was to analyze climate change trends and how humans are mostly responsible for these trends. Based on the data I gathered, I concluded that there has been a considerable change in temperature, which has been rapidly increasing. <br> The Original data shows that highest variation in average temperature was recorded in India in past six years. China is right behind India and Canada has recorded third highest increse in temperature.</p>
  <h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-on-food-disposal-crop-residue-data">Naive Bayes on Temperature data. </h4> <p> dataset was trained to predict temperature forecasts in several nations based on historical temperature data, and the model is 95% accurate in most cases, predicting higher temperatures than projected temperatures. This indicates that the temperature is rising and that we are on the verge of global warming. The data for the temperature record for the previous five years is collected, the expectation assumptions are formed, and the Bayes model is used to forecast the temperature difference. The accuracy of the models was 95% in each case. The precision for this data is fairly good, indicating that the model can accurately forecast temperature variance. More data can be used to improve the model.</p>
<p>The link between humans impacting the environment and the environment affecting humans is obvious, but for the time being, I’d like to focus on the human impact on climate change. The large temperature shift is caused by the release of hazardous components into the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane.</p>
<p>As an illustration of how humans emit dangerous components into the atmosphere, I gathered data on emissions caused by waste food disposal and crop residue in the United States. I chose these two domains because agricultural cultivation and food disposal are fundamental human activities. If we can inflict environmental damage through everyday activities, the repercussions of a nuclear power plant are unthinkable.</p>
<section id="naive-bayes-on-food-disposal-crop-residue-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-on-food-disposal-crop-residue-data">Naive Bayes on Food Disposal Crop Residue Data</h4>
<p>The model has been trained to recognize the emission element. The model was trained to classify various emission constituents. The data set was divided into two parts: training and testing. The model correctly classified the items 74% of the time. The model forecasts the emission based on the domain and item that triggered it. Food disposal and crop residue are the domains considered&nbsp;here. The prediction aids in avoiding hazardous emissions such as CO2 caused by any crop or food disposal process, and&nbsp;may be able to identify an alternative for that process.</p>

<section id="svm-on-food-disposal-and-crop-residue-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="svm-on-food-disposal-and-crop-residue-data">SVM on Food Disposal and Crop Residue Data</h4>
<p>The same data set with the same purpose was used to classify the emissions using SVM, various kernels were used to see which kernel gave the highest accuracy. Linear kernel was the most accurate with 89% accuracy</p>
</section>
<section id="arm-and-networking-on-food-disposal-and-crop-residue-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arm-and-networking-on-food-disposal-and-crop-residue-data">ARM and Networking on Food Disposal and Crop Residue Data</h4>
<p>The goal was to find the association rules between the variables of data set, a lot of interesting asoociations were found after applying apriori to the data set. The model gives insight on how each variable is linked and how these relations can be used for better understanding and analysis.</p>
<p>Air Quality Data: The data set gives an overview of toxins present in the air in New York city and how it’s effects on people. I chose this data set to analyse the consequences of climate change on humans.</p>
</section>
<section id="naive-bayes-on-air-quality-data." class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-on-air-quality-data.">Naive Bayes on Air Quality data.</h4>
<p>The naive bayes model is applied to find out the conditional probability of air quality, people affected by the pollution and their age group. To do this, data on air quality and its effects on individuals was analyzed. After separating the model into train and test data, the model was trained to predict air quality, age group, and number of persons impacted by pollution. The model has an accuracy of 84%.</p>
</section>
<section id="svm-on-air-quality-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="svm-on-air-quality-data">SVM on Air Quality data:</h4>
<p>The degree of precision generated by different kernels varied. Finally, the linear kernel is ideally suited for the most accurate data. With a 70% accuracy, the model forecasts the age group of people affected by air pollution in New York City.</p>
<p>Naive Bayes is the best fit for this data. Because the data set is quite huge, Naive Bayes is the best prediction method.</p>
</section>
<section id="clustering-on-air-quality-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-on-air-quality-data">Clustering on Air Quality data:</h4>
<p>This data is clustered to get insight into the underlying patterns of several concentration measures. The purpose of clustering was to look for similarities in the toxicity of air quality. To get the outcome, three distinct clustering techniques were used, K-means, density-based spatial clustering with noise, and hierarchical clustering. The model demonstrates that the toxicities aren’t very diverse to one other in an attempt to discover similarities within the air toxicity.</p>
<p>In addition to these record data, I attempted to obtain people’s opinions on climate change by gathering data from Twitter. The purpose was to understand the significance and views of climate change, along with other global issues.</p>
</section>
<section id="naive-bayes-on-text-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="naive-bayes-on-text-data">Naive Bayes on Text data</h4>
<p>I applied Naive Bayes on twitter data collected on two hash tags, climatechange and savetheplanet to understand the similiraties and dissimilarities between these two hashtags. I chose these two hashtags to understand the relevance of climatechange as a global issue among other affairs. The model was trained to classify the tweets into these two hashtags with 89% accuracy. The precision is quite high.</p>
</section>
<section id="decision-tree-on-text-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="decision-tree-on-text-data">Decision Tree on Text data</h4>
<p>With the same goal of understanding the opinions and classifying the tweets decision trees was implemented on the text data After determining the best maximum depth for the tree, the model achieves 97% accuracy. This implies that the model classifies tweets based on hashtags 97% of the time. This outperforms the Naive Bayes Classifier. Although the hashtags are related, there are key factors that distinguish these two hashtags, and the model is successfully discriminating these tweets.</p>
</section>
<section id="clustering-on-text-data" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering-on-text-data">Clustering on Text data</h4>
<p>The goal was to collect twitter data on climate change and air pollution, I chose these to hastags to understand the how air pollution is affecting climate change in people’s opinion. Clustering was applied on the data and it resulted in dense clusters which means closely connected words, and comparable words in separate tweets are possible. From the clusters formed we can say that there are many similar words between tweets with these two hashtags.</p>
